Joshua, confused, reads out his peculiar solution, maybe it means something by ear? BANG! The photo of his parents’ wedding swings down, held onto by the rusty bottom hinges, revealing a dark green computer screen:

PASSWORD: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Flabbergasted, Joshua is not prepared for what comes next. He gets a notification on his phone; he has received an e-mail! 
I thought those were extinct.

## [Intermediate Part 1]

The contents are shown in “email.txt”. Joshua realises what to do. He must calculate how many times each character on the right appears in the string, to make a 3-digit number. Then he must repeat that for all 8 lines to get 8 3-digit numbers. But he needs your help. What are the 8 numbers?

## [Intermediate Part 2]

The e-mail contains an attachment, entitled “How Many.txt”, which contains  a long string of random characters. Immediately, Joshua realises what is going on. He must calculate which character appears that many times in the file, for each of the 8 numbers, then string them together to find the password. Easy! So easy, that he needs your help. What is the password? Remember space is a character.
