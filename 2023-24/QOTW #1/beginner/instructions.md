Enter Joshua, son of Joshua Smith himself – renowned man amongst men. Cut to Saturday morning, Joshua woke up early and his parents are still asleep, and he heard the letterbox. In true gen Z style, he wondered who send letters these days? Heading downstairs, he felt the suspenseful creak of every step. The envelope read:

## TOP SECRET – FOR RECIPIENT’S EYES ONLY

Joshua had never received a top-secret message before, so he eagerly opened it, to find a string of 1s and 0s. But he was not fooled so easily, recognising it as 7-bit ASCII, with a 0 beginning each byte as padding. Make Joshua a program that converts whitespace-separated bytes to a string of character with ASCII. Hint: research the Python chr() and ord() functions. Hence decode:

```
01010011 01001111 01010011
```

### [Beginner Part 1][Beginner Part 2]
Decode the contents of “TOP SECRET.txt”. What message to a robotic friend is contained in the letter? Ignore the fact that the bytes are spread across different lines, remove the line breaks to make it compatible with part 1’s program.
