Long story short, this past week in QOTW:
1. Joshua fell down a hole in the advanced section (which seems to have gotten stuck in limbo).
2. The easy section was too hard.

Anyway...

To avoid being graphic, after suspensefully falling down a hole at the end of last week, Joshua landed in a foam pit. Next to him lay a paper grid that looked about 100x100 and contained two distinct characters: S and L.

## [BEGINNER PART 1]

How many L characters are in grid.txt?

## [BEGINNER PART 2]

1. Write a function that takes in zero-indexed co-ords (x, y) and outputs how many L characters are in the 3x3 box (8 possible) around the character at the co-ords. 
2. Find the sum of the outputs at (27, 32), (91, 98), (12, 87), (46, 17) in grid.txt.
