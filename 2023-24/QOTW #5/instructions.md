*The process* refers to replacing every run of identical numbers with the count and character, eg., **11122** -> **3122**.

## Part 1

For each of the first 5 strings, apply the process 20 times and get the length of the result. Add these lengths together for the answer.

## Part 2

List the characters in order of increasing count after reversing the process once on the 6th string. Break ties with greater numbers last.

## Part 3

The 6th string is derived by applying the process on one of the 5 strings above it, but how many times?
